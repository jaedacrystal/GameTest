# UI List Animation

A powerful and flexible Unity UI list animation system that makes it easy to add beautiful animation effects to UI elements in lists or grids. This animation system depends on DOTween.

## Features

- Multiple animation types supported:
  - Position Animation
  - Scale Animation
  - Rotation Animation
  - Transparency Animation (CanvasGroup)

- Two layout modes:
  - Linear List (Normal)
  - Grid Layout (Grid)

- Rich animation configuration options:
  - Custom easing functions (multiple built-in Ease types)
  - Custom animation curves
  - Flexible time control (Interval mode/Duration mode)
  - Adjustable start delay
  - Support for animation preview

## System Requirements

- Unity 2020.3 or higher
- DOTween/Pro (required)

## Installation

1. Import the UIListAnimationSystem folder into your Unity project
2. Make sure DOTween/Pro plugin is installed

## Quick Start

1. Create Animation Configuration:
   - Right-click in the Project window
   - Select Create > UIListAnimation > Animation Config
   - Configure your animation properties (position, scale, rotation, transparency, etc.)

2. Set up UI List:
   - Select your UI list container node in the Hierarchy
   - Add UIListAnimator component
   - Select the animation configuration you created
   - Choose play mode (Normal/Grid)

3. Runtime Settings:
   - Play On Enable: Automatically play animation when enabled
   - Additional Delay: Extra delay time
   - Play Mode: Choose Normal (list) or Grid mode
   - Grid Settings: Set rows and columns (available only in Grid mode)

## Animation Configuration Details

### Basic Settings
- Start Delay: Delay time before animation starts
- Item Mode: Choose time mode
  - Interval: Fixed time interval between each item
  - Duration: Animation duration gradually increases for each item

### Animation Properties
Each animation property can include:
- Animation type (Position/Scale/Rotation/CanvasGroup)
- Start and end values
- Animation duration
- Easing type or custom animation curve

## Grid Mode Features

In grid mode, you can:
- Customize the number of rows and columns
- Adjust animation playback order through visual editor
- Preview grid layout and sequence numbers

## Best Practices

1. Recommended UI Structure:
```
- List Container (with UIListAnimator script)
  - Item 1
    - Item Parent     <---  Target node to be controlled, must have CanvasGroup component.
      - Content1
      - Content2
      - Content3
      ...
  - Item 2
    - Item Parent     <---  Target node to be controlled, must have CanvasGroup component.
      - Content1
      - Content2
      - Content3
      ...
  - Item 3
    - Item Parent     <---  Target node to be controlled, must have CanvasGroup component.
      - Content1
      - Content2
      - Content3
      ...
  ...
```

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Set reasonable animation duration and intervals
   - Avoid too many simultaneous animations
   - Use object pooling for optimization when appropriate

3. Animation Design Tips:
   - Keep animations simple, avoid overuse
   - Ensure animations enhance rather than interfere with user experience
   - Consider using combined animations for richer effects

## Important Notes

- CanvasGroup animation type requires CanvasGroup component on target objects
- Grid size modifications in editor will automatically adjust sequence numbers
- Preview animation button is only available during runtime

## Code Examples

```csharp
// Method 1: Get UIListAnimator component and call Play method directly
var animator = gameObject.GetComponent<UIListAnimator>();
animator.Play();

// Method 2: Set configuration before playing
var animator = gameObject.GetComponent<UIListAnimator>();
// Load configuration through Resources
var config = Resources.Load<AnimationConfig>("Path/To/Your/Config");
// Or load configuration through GUID
var config = AssetDatabase.LoadAssetAtPath<AnimationConfig>(AssetDatabase.GUIDToAssetPath("Your_Config_GUID"));
animator.Config = config;
animator.Play();

// Method 3: Adjust delay time before playing
var animator = gameObject.GetComponent<UIListAnimator>();
animator.additionalDelay = 0.5f; // Set additional delay time
animator.Play();

// Stop animation
animator.Stop();
```

**Notes:**
1. Ensure a valid animation configuration (Config) is set before calling `Play()`
2. If using CanvasGroup type animation, make sure target nodes have CanvasGroup component
3. `Play()` method can be called repeatedly, it will automatically stop previous animation and start new one
4. If you need to stop animation midway, call the `Stop()` method
